# Movie-Analysis

Some meaningful insights were derived from analysing the IMBD data provided by RSVP as 
they are planning to make projects beyond Indian boundaries. 

RSVP should plan to release in December month as least movies were released in this month
so they get more focus and considering the international market, ‘Drama’should be preferred
out of 13 genres, as they are more released worldwide & the length of the movie should not 
exceed 115 minutes. The average duration from Horror to Action ranges between 92 minutes 
to 113 minutes. Thriller genre ranks 3rd in terms of number of movies produced next to Drama 
and Action. 

Production companies like “Dream Warrior Pictures” & “National Theatre Live” have 
produced more hit movies, Production houses with highest number of multilingual hits are
“Star Cinema” & “Twentieth Century Fox”. James Mangold and Marvel Studios tops the 
Director & Production House list respectively. Steven Soderbergh has directed 4 movies with 
average rating of 6.47 and is in top 9 Director’s list. So, based on the ideas, RSVP can partner 
with any of them for the next projects.

If RSVP wants to hire few Indian Actors along with international stars, then, Vijay Sethupathi,
Mammootty & Mohal Lal have ratings > 8 and Taapsee Pannu has 7.74 who leads the Actress 
list. Parvathy Thiruvothu, Susan Brown, Amanda Lawrance are the top 3 actresses with more
Super Hit movies & average rating > 8 in the Drama genre. 
We have summarized the above insights based on plethora of analysis.
